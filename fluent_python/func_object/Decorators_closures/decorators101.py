"""  What is Decorators  """

""" A decorator is a callable that takes another function as argument (the decorated function). 
The decorator may perform some processing with the decorated function, and returns it or replaces it with another function or callable object.

and vice versa.

More information on decorator:
1. A decorator is a function or another callable.
2. A decorator may replace the decorated function with different one
3. A decorator are executed immediately when a module is loaded.

""" How decorators are employed in real code or world. Basically there is two ways :"""

# The decorator function is defined in same module as the decorated function.
#  The register decorator returns the same function passed as argument. but most of decorator define an inner function and return it.


# Variable Scope Rules:

# Example 9-3: function reading a local variable and global

# If we want the interpreter to treat b as a global variable and still assign a new value to
# it within the function, we use the global declaration:
b = 30
def f1(a):
    global b
    print(a)
    print(b)
    b = 21

f1(34)
print(b)

# in above example : We Saw Two scopes in action:======
"""
1.The module global scope: made of names assigned at the top level of the module file.
2. The local scope: made of names assigned to value as parameters, or directly within a function body.

# Variable lookup Logic

"""
When a function is defined, the Python bytecode compiler determines how to fetch a
variable x that appears in it, based on these rules:
1. if there is a global variable x declaration, x comes from and is assigned to the x global variable module.

2. if there is nonlocal x declaration, x comes from and is assigned to the local variable x in the nearest enclosing function. where x defined

3.if x is a parameter  or is assigned in the function body, it is local variable of the function.

4. if x is a refferenced but not assigned and not a parameter:
    â€” x will be looked up in the local scopes of the surrounding function bodies
    (nonlocal scopes)   
    â€” If not found in surrounding scopes, it will be read from the module global
    scope.
    â€” If not found in the global scope, it will be read from __builtins__.__dict__.
