Note: The scope of the num_length and num_sum variables is 
the same in the example with the walrus operator and in the example without. 
This means that in both examples, the variables are available after the definition of description.

Even though both examples are very similar functionally, 
a benefit of using the assignment expressions is that the := operator communicates 
the intent of these variables as throwaway optimizations.
